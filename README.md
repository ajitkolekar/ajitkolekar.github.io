<img align="center" src="images/Marketing-campaign-concept.jpg" width="500" height="300"/>
<p align="justify">Every retail organization spends millions of dollars on advertising to attract the customers to their stores. If the advertising is not done effectively, it is possible that the customers that received the promotional offers might not accept them, resulting in lost opportunity cost in the promotional offers. It is also possible that the customers that can be attracted to the store based on promotional offers might have not received the offers. It is important for the retail organizations to know which customers are the best suitable candidates to send promotional offers, so that the advertising budget can be optimally utilized. Data science machine learning models can play a significant role in identifying customer behavior by using historical data. If the retail organizations can use the machine learning models to predict the ideal customers, the advertising budget can be spent wisely by only targeting customers that are willing to accept promotional offers and spend money at the store.</p>

<img align="center" src="images/Admission-banner.jpg" width="500" height="300" />
<p align="justify">After graduating with a bachelor’s degree, most of the international students face a decision about which university to select for their Master of Science program, and what are their chances to get into one of the universities they selected. Several universities have various requirements to determine which students should be admitted to their programs. Most international students are required to provide Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) exam scores since English is their secondary language. Most universities base their decisions on Graduate Record Examinations (GRE) scores as well. There are several other factors, such as student’s GPA and university ranking that are used by the universities for admissions. Data science machine learning model can help determine the chance of getting admitted to a specific university based on the factors, such as TOEFL score, GRE score, GPA, and so on. This will help the students to short list universities where they have better chances of getting admitted based on their credentials.</p>

<a href="https://github.com/ajitkolekar/Data-Science-Projects/tree/main/Combating%20Fraudulent%20Transactions">3. Combating Fraudulent Transactions - Research</a></h3>
<img align="center" src="images/fraud.jpg" width="500" height="200" />
<p align="justify">Data Science is a new wave in the Technological field and it is used everywhere. It is an interdisciplinary field that comprises Data Analysis models, Machine Learning algorithms, and statistics for scientific methods. The goal of the research paper is to elaborate more on Data Science use in the financial sector, focusing on detecting and/or predicting fraud in the banking industry, and also learning what necessary planning methods are used to create a system to tackle banking fraud. The research paper focuses on key technologies involved in classifying transactions as either legitimate or fraudulent, based on transaction details, such as amount, merchant, location, time, and many more; identity fraud, where someone impersonates you and uses your personal information to steal money; phishing, where internet banking clients receive deceptive emails asking them to give account login, password, and personal details on a website which looks like the bank’s legitimate website.</p>
